## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities & Attributes

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - A user can have many bookings and reviews.

- **Properties**
  - `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`
  - Each property belongs to one user (owner) and can have many bookings.

- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  - A booking is made by a user for a specific property.

- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - A review is written by a user about a property.

- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`
  - Payments are associated with confirmed bookings.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and role-based access. Crucial for authentication and personalization.

### Property Management
Allows property owners to list, edit, and remove properties. Essential for content creation and visibility.

### Booking System
Enables users to view availability and book properties. Central to the platform‚Äôs business functionality.

### Payment Integration
Facilitates secure and trackable payment processes tied to bookings. Ensures financial transactions are handled safely.

### Review System
Allows users to leave feedback and ratings on properties. Builds trust and improves service quality.

## üîê API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Implement JWT to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin, host, guest).
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects endpoints from abuse and DoS attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks and ensures clean data.
- **HTTPS & Secure Headers**: Protects data in transit and mitigates common vulnerabilities.

### Why Security Matters

- **User Data Protection**: Safeguards personal and financial information.
- **Transaction Integrity**: Ensures payment operations are tamper-proof.
- **Platform Trust**: Builds user confidence and prevents malicious access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code to ensure rapid, reliable software delivery.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: For running tests, linters, and build workflows.
- **Docker**: To create consistent development and production environments.

### Benefits

- Reduces human error and increases deployment speed.
- Ensures new code changes are tested and integrated smoothly.
- Facilitates faster feedback loops in development.
